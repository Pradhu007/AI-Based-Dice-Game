# AI-Based-Dice-Game
Because of boredom, i have written myself a dice rolling game which lets you play a dice game   against an ai . The Program randomly picks a number depending on the number of sides given. Every time, a user or an AI  wins a round, it increments the winnings count. Please have fun playing this game and support my repo so i could upload more awesome projects in the future
