# AI-Based-Dice-Game
Because of boredom, i have written myself a dice rolling game written in Python using OOP which lets you play a dice game   against an AI . The Program randomly picks a number depending on the number of sides given.The program simulates two players taking it in turns to roll a customizable -sided dice, and keeps track of the scores. It makes use of the three basic control structures of sequence, selection and iteration. Please have fun playing this game and support my repo so i could upload more awesome projects in the upcoming  future
